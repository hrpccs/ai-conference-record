Eight two one. Alright morning guys? Alright One here one. Sir cheese stuart cabin. He's come down to just observe today.

Alright from upstairs. Be shut something he can explain later. So let's kick off us... Yeah. So yesterday I was working on the evening on the main product page.

And, yeah. It went alright. I was using the Zoom fx plug, and that will seem to work fine. Test running. Okay.

Me what like are we using that? It's effects, You know, the one we were using yeah. I thought we were gonna use jquery crew for that. Yeah. Where we we did some tests against Jquery now wasn't gonna be a performance.

So we're gonna use the Zoom effects plugin and it seems to be handling large which is okay. So I'm gonna spend a bit of time on that today just to make sure that dev service will okay. I think I'm gonna get any blockers unless we have saw memory issues. But Okay. Yeah.

Is good. Mh. Right. Well, it so was testing the shipping basket. And seems we.

Okay. Two today such says the the payment system with breakout cards so. And suggest issues with a different type of curves. So gotta raise that to somebody. Okay.

So yes, today testing uploading to default images and some advertising stuff cross browser checks and some motivated automated tests. For question. In neighborhoods. Fine. Okay.

Yes was working on the main page front anyway some of the folks that Qa still looking into. So gotta do a couple more course browser checks, but think it should be okay. Basically, we had some minor issues, things that place text. So. Yesterday, finalized they design and it's going well.

Request just changing some of the buttons to be more gentle. So can do that and tidy of the wild. So you maths what's Good. Okay. So yesterday today, I was working on the day out with cape.

Like I said in the standard yesterday, that's definitely not like a nine point cut. That's that's. In fact I said that on Monday when I was going with Jim, and I'm pretty sure someone said is in a stand up that it's not a nine point. So Think kind like probably. Probably ten or something but I'm not really sure.

But anyway, we had a reasonably good day yesterday. Notwithstanding the day that's problem in the morning. That didn't really affect us, but obviously, there was a lot of disruption around, so we can distract a bit and the fire that went off in afternoon to. And They're also... We...

There only ten minutes but went to go get a couple of coffee quotes, you know, stuff for. So the business getting down to chat to is. There's some overlap with what we're doing what when where'd did you get the company? It's the new place on the bridge? It's Not this up.

And it's all well it's... It's a bit more money than the one next door, but it's upstairs, we go to the one the careful just trying the corner. Yeah. Yeah. Occasionally about.

But fine that little. But let integration. Well, it's. Problem. Any problems.

Yeah. Well, there's some mobile overlap between we're doing. Delete part. But we can't really resolve them to be honest sunday. Were problems but they're now can't go the way.

So we had a reasonable. Anymore. I mean this is like on then, Terry. Yeah. We'll with that today.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I was working with jake yesterday. As you just explained and probably just be doing same same sort of stuff again tomorrow.

Any problems. No. Just what Jake said. Yeah. Probably say.

Okay. For the rest of the week. I should imagine on this. Great welcome. No.

So mister trent Yeah. Just working on some fun and stuff yesterday. We'll see you again probably we just carry on again with that today. Yeah. Good problems.

Nothing think today. Okay. Alright. Okay. Yesterday was working on styling in the delete button.

It's going very well. Actually, a few problems in our e states as always, but It's gonna find that she crack it by the end the day. And I'm just coming with that. So yeah yesterday, I was working with John some San also of bit functionality on that. And we're thinking today that was kinda get boring.

We talked to nickel advertising. There's some issues that having. Kind relating to anyone to doing for all of the Those guys we've is settled with the work. So probably, wonder way could take me himself pair. We depend up head over there.

Think some consolation they they have a few days stuff Okay. Alright. Sounds good. Thanks, guys. Give us to what.

Eight two one. Alright morning guys? Alright One here one. Sir cheese stuart cabin. He's come down to just observe today.

Alright from upstairs. Be shut something he can explain later. So let's kick off us... Yeah. So yesterday I was working on the evening on the main product page.

And, yeah. It went alright. I was using the Zoom fx plug, and that will seem to work fine. Test running. Okay.

Me what like are we using that? It's effects, You know, the one we were using yeah. I thought we were gonna use jquery crew for that. Yeah. Where we we did some tests against Jquery now wasn't gonna be a performance.

So we're gonna use the Zoom effects plugin and it seems to be handling large which is okay. So I'm gonna spend a bit of time on that today just to make sure that dev service will okay. I think I'm gonna get any blockers unless we have saw memory issues. But Okay. Yeah.

Is good. Mh. Right. Well, it so was testing the shipping basket. And seems we.

Okay. Two today such says the the payment system with breakout cards so. And suggest issues with a different type of curves. So gotta raise that to somebody. Okay.

So yes, today testing uploading to default images and some advertising stuff cross browser checks and some motivated automated tests. For question. In neighborhoods. Fine. Okay.

Yes was working on the main page front anyway some of the folks that Qa still looking into. So gotta do a couple more course browser checks, but think it should be okay. Basically, we had some minor issues, things that place text. So. Yesterday, finalized they design and it's going well.

Request just changing some of the buttons to be more gentle. So can do that and tidy of the wild. So you maths what's Good. Okay. So yesterday today, I was working on the day out with cape.

Like I said in the standard yesterday, that's definitely not like a nine point cut. That's that's. In fact I said that on Monday when I was going with Jim, and I'm pretty sure someone said is in a stand up that it's not a nine point. So Think kind like probably. Probably ten or something but I'm not really sure.

But anyway, we had a reasonably good day yesterday. Notwithstanding the day that's problem in the morning. That didn't really affect us, but obviously, there was a lot of disruption around, so we can distract a bit and the fire that went off in afternoon to. And They're also... We...

There only ten minutes but went to go get a couple of coffee quotes, you know, stuff for. So the business getting down to chat to is. There's some overlap with what we're doing what when where'd did you get the company? It's the new place on the bridge? It's Not this up.

And it's all... Well it's... It's a bit more money than the one next door, but it's upstairs, we go to the one the careful just trying the corner. Yeah. Yeah.

Occasionally about. But fine that little. But let integration. Well, it's. Problem.

Any problems. Yeah. Well, there's some mobile overlap between we're doing. Delete part. But we can't really resolve them to be honest sunday.

Were problems but they're now can't go the way. So we had a reasonable. Anymore. I mean this is like on then, Terry. Yeah.

We'll with that today. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I was working with jake yesterday.

As you just explained and probably just be doing same same sort of stuff again tomorrow. Any problems. No. Just what Jake said. Yeah.

Probably say. Okay. For the rest of the week. I should imagine on this. Great welcome.

No. So mister trent Yeah. Just working on some fun and stuff yesterday. We'll see you again probably we just carry on again with that today. Yeah.

Good problems. Nothing think today. Okay. Alright. Okay.

Yesterday was working on styling in the delete button. It's going very well. Actually, a few problems in our e states as always, but It's gonna find that she crack it by the end the day. And I'm just coming with that. So yeah yesterday, I was working with John some San also of bit functionality on that.
