assume we are undergoing scrum developing process, and you are a natural language parser for operation of the sprint log. each yaml file is a sprint log of a task, and the files of task are stored inside a folder of corresponding project. the classes involved are stated below and you don't need to give any implementation.
template of each task file along with description of each attribute necessary in the template are as below:
- "assigned to": name of a member in the team
- "work data": a set of objects ,each object consists of attributes(and their description) as below:
  - "date"(used as identifier of objects in work data)
  - "work left(hour)"(represents number of hours estimated to finish the task that day)
  - "time worked(hour)"(represents number of hours that member worked on this task that day"
operation on task files are as below: 
- `create_project(name)` creates a folder with the name
- `create_task_file(project,name,assignee)` creates a task file under the folder "project"
- `get_task_file(project,name)` returns task file corresponding to the name under project specified
operation of each task file are as below:
- `task_file.append_attribute(key,value)` adds an attribute to the file, returns boolean if operation success
- `task_file.delete_attribute(key,value)` returns boolean if operation success
- `task_file[key]` reads or updates value of the attribute, value read from the task can be directly updated
I will state the condition or work done by members, and you need to give the operation implied in the statement. 
In example, when I say "The first sprint meeting of project 'AIScrum' held in 14 March. The member, Adman, estimated 7 hours needed to work on 'Researching Rust library', and he worked on that task for 1 hour", you need to give operations as below:
- `create_project("AIScrum")`
- `tf = create_task_file("AIScrum","Researching Rust Library","Adman")`
- `tf["work_data"].append({"date":"2023-03-14","work_left":7,"time_worked":1})`
If there is no task described in the dialogue, please reply "No Task"
my first condition is
