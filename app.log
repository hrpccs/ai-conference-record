Welcome to this daily Scrum live demo session. Friends, we all know that after Scrum Guide 2020 updates, traditional three questions are no longer mandatory. So in this session, we are giving you totally different new trending daily Scrum questions, which you can also propose to your teams. So this session is also going to benefit for all new one of these Scrum Masters who want to know how daily Scrum looks like. And after watching this session, they can gain more confidence. Friends, we really appreciate if you hit one like for our team members efforts. Your one leg is a big motivation for all of us. And if you new to our channel, please do subscribe for more real life valuable content. So without further delay, let\'s begin our session over to you Shashank. Yep, before we get into the topic. So that\'s me. So my name is Shashank Patchnuri. I\'m a Scrum Master in India with 10 years of IT experience. I am a Najal enthusiast helping organizations and teams on their journey towards agile transformation. With the Najal mindset using various frameworks tools and techniques. Now let\'s get into the topic. Yes, so really Scrum meeting rules. So what is daily Scrum for those who are new to agile and being the beginning there agile journey. Allow me to take a couple of minutes to brief you about daily Scrum meeting. The daily Scrum is one of the five events the Scrum framework offers. The daily Scrum is often referred to as the stand up, which comes from extreme programming. And Scrum framework on each day of the sprint the whole the team holds a daily sprint meeting called the daily Scrum. Meetings are typically held in the same location and at the same time each day ideally a daily Scrum meeting is held in the morning as it happened and as has it helps set the context for the coming days work. These crum meetings are strictly time box to 15 minutes. This keeps the discussions brisk but relevant. The purpose of the daily Scrum is to help progress towards the sprint goal and to form a 24 hour plan to increase the likelihood of the sprint goal being met. All team members are required to attend Scrum meetings. And both the Scrum master and the product owner are committed to the members. They are expected to attend and participate. Anyone else for example a department wise president salesperson or a developer from another project is allowed to attend as a passive audience and listen. This makes Scrum meetings an excellent way for a scrum team to decimate information. If you\'re interested in hearing where where things are at attend that these meeting the daily Scrum meeting is not used as a problem solving or issue issue resolved issue resolution meeting. Rather issues are raised and taken offline and usually dealt with by the relevant subgroup immediately after the meeting. During the daily Scrum each team member answers the following three questions. What did you do yesterday? What will you do today? Are there any impediments in your way? By focusing on what first what each person accomplished yesterday and will accomplish today the team gains an excellent understanding of what work has been done and what work remains. The daily Scrum meeting is not a status update meeting in which a boss is collecting information about who is behind schedule. Rather it is a meeting in which team members make commitments to each other. Any impediments that are raised in the Scrum meeting become the Scrum master\'s responsibility to ensure that are that they are resolved as quickly as possible. Typical impediments are for example I need help debugging a program or problem with an xyz or I\'m struggling to learn xyz and would like to pair with someone on it. Or it also can be I cannot get these ones so group give me any time and I need to meet with them or you can say some another example could be the departmental VP has asked me to work on something else for a day or two. You might have heard most of such scenarios with your teams as well. In such cases where the Scrum masters cannot remove these impediments directly by himself. Example usually the more technical issues when which we have a brief right now one of the examples he is still a responsibility for making sure someone on the team does quickly resolve the issue. Most teams conduct the daily Scrum meeting by having each person answer the three questions in order. You answer all three questions then the next person and the next and so on. An interesting alternative that some teams find helpful is to talk through one product backlog item before moving on to the next in this way and individual may get an update at multiple different times during the same meeting. Now let\'s take a look at the set of questions that we have all right so set a is nothing but the classic questions that we often keep using them. It could be different for a different sentence framework might wait right the questions might vary based on the framework of the question. What story did you work on yesterday who worked on it with you. And what story did you plan to tackle today what will you work with on it who will you work with on it. What obstacles if any do you anticipate finishing. So these set of classic questions are commonly used in all the teams both new and experienced teams. Now let us take a look at the new training set of questions that enable the teams to have a different perspective and think out of the box. The next set of questions is called as shared learning. In this set of questions can help teams which are in the forming stage which have begun the journey towards agile transformation. And it\'s can help teams to share their ways of learning, beat research or investigation. They\'re doing throughout the day to ensure the set of tax or commitments for the day are completed. This will help team members to share different ways of approach to one problem which can help other team members. The questions are in the work you did yesterday. What did you learn that could help the whole team. Who to learn today. How will you share it with all of us. What gets in your way of learning. And comes the next set of questions wherein you\'re trying to find some help. This set of questions can help new and experienced teams which are in forming or non-mixed stage. The questions allow team members to share their library of knowledge that their effort to in order to address any issues or challenges. These questions allows teams to explore and share knowledge or sources of knowledge and help each other. The questions are what helpful resources, example websites, books, articles, repositories, team members, expertise, etc. And you can share your work wherever you look for help today. When have you found it difficult to find helpful resources. What gets in the way. The next set of questions are said, D that is achieving the plan. In this set of questions can help both the can help the experienced teams strategize to achieve the plan. No sprint goal can be achieved by a single person in the team. It is a collaborative effort of the whole team. With these questions, it reminds all the team members. All the team players to know how important their role is to achieve the plan. By using the conference index towards the end of the questions on a scale of 0 to 5. We come up. We come to know the pulse of the team, which boosts their morale and confidence sprint, confidence level sprint after sprint. Let\'s take a look at the questions. How did you help the team move towards achieving our iteration plan yesterday. How will you help us move forward in the plan today. What will impede your progress. How will you help us move forward in the plan. On a scale of 0 to 5. Zero being no way and 5 being super confident. How confident are you that we will complete all the work in our iteration plan. Coming to the last but not the least set of questions. What are the questions. What are the questions. What did you commit yesterday. What do you hope to commit today. What hinders your ability to continuously integrate your work today. Those were some interesting questions. I hope these are something different, which you can help your teams to come up with different ideas and thoughts during your daily scrum meeting. I would also like to share a couple of basic rules or maybe you can say just during the meetings, which I share with my teams. So some news and don\'ts in a meeting, which can really be helpful for your meetings to be more effective and more informative. So the do\'s are please turn on your camera for all the meetings. So I request all my team members to turn on the cameras. Why the camera should be turned on. So as we are all a connected virtually. The two most important factors that we need to utilize to the fullest to ensure maximum exchange of information via communication is audio and video in any virtual meeting. This will help the facilitator, the scrum master to know if you\'re able to keep up with the discussion or you want us to slow down. And the another important point is that this will also help the facilitator know that if you that you are participating in the meeting 100% as we might need your thoughts and inputs during any point of the meeting. And the most next important point is ensure internet connection is stable and bandwidth is good enough to support video calls. And the don\'ts are please do not multitask during any meeting. Team might get met need your 100% attention to provide suggestions and valuable inputs during the meeting. Don\'t be late to meetings always join the meeting on time to have a productive and time box meetings to our extension that might impact the following meetings. So these do\'s and don\'ts are for any meeting regardless of any event throughout your day. Right. So I think these are some basic instructions that we can share with our teams. So I just thought to share with you all. All right. I think that was it for today. Hey, thanks ashan for the presentation. Over to you, Shashank. You can start the demo now. Thank you. So let me quickly start sharing my screen and begin my thought in this country. All right. I hope you are all able to see my screen. Yes. Awesome. So yes, guys. So let me be doing our daily strom everyday using some classic questions, right? The regular questions that we have. What you work on yesterday, what story you plan for today and what impermeasantly. Right. So just to blame that, monotonous questions. So we have come up with some new set of questions like we just introduced on day one of us. Today, we are. So let us go ahead with this set of questions that is said to be where Neha will be sharing her plan for the day. Yeah. Over to you, Neha. Yeah. Hi, Shashank. Good morning. So yesterday I worked on UI creation for login page. I have learned the optimized way of routing the page. So basically this will help our team towards to achieve our initial step towards our print pool. So today I will be working on database creation of login page. So here after today\'s task, I will hoping to learn to write the optimized way or good way of query basically. So in the average task that I do, basically I will definitely I learn definitely I learned something. So when I will complete my all the task, I\'m I\'m hoping or I will be in a part to learn about a database like how to increase the memory of database or how to write a good query. That is all from my intuition. Nice. Thanks. Thanks. Okay. All right. Now let\'s move on to the next set of questions and a set C finding help. So the become what you like to share your updates on your story with respect to these persons. Sure, Shashank. So I\'m working with respect to SS 11 user story. So with respect to that task, I have been contacted I contacted Ramya like our CEO with respect to few inputs as discussed in the last call. So she has given me few changes and almost 6270% I have completed down the task. And regarding where will you look up for the help today, I want your help because I have to contact the squad team and also central fixers what Ramya suggested as per that. And this is the impediment I am facing and you can give me to us and before that I will try to investigate from my end and if it is not possible, I\'ll reach out to you for help. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Now let\'s go to the next set of questions that said be okay over to you. Yeah, sure. So as for the sprint goal, we are targeting to implement the login page for the portal itself in this print. So for that, my story was related to the masking of the login page password. So I tried yesterday building on a framework which can easily enable the functionality, but currently I am facing. So my plan was to move ahead forward today, but yesterday I had connected with some teams who have already worked on it, but somehow is that is not working, maybe the graph capacity or they don\'t have time for help. So Sheshankar would need your help in this to help me solve this impediment and on a scale of zero to five. I am currently not very confident because we are on the fifth day of the sprint. So we would be maybe on a scale of five I\'m at to currently if we get little help, I\'m sure we\'ll be able to do the story. Sure, definitely, we can the problem and we get to speak with those team members and get all the help you need to make it. All right, thank you. Thank you. And Manoj, would you like to share your updates? Yes, sure, Shankar. So my name is SS 14. As we committed the implementation for login functionality, right, so the backend part is already completed implementation of the services and the UI part was taken care by the pick up that also completed, but the challenging part here was the backend, the production data, which we are expecting from the client set to validate the same from the development perspective. I hope we are getting this today. So that there are no impediments at this moment. We have completed all the development part. Only thing is waiting for the testing from development and if we have completing, then we are good. So part of like confident level from zero to five, I could say like we are sure we\'ll complete my today. That\'s great. Thanks, Manoj. Thanks for the word of confidence there. All right, so now let\'s go to the next set of questions that is said, e and in this integration. So we are seeing you. Hey, hi, Shashank. Hi, everyone. So minus three. Yes. All right. Thank you, Shashank. So Shashank on this, I do have four subclass like a full name email address user name password. I have to create. I\'m done with the full name username and password yesterday. I was about to finish all this item. I was committed to do that. However, I was facing some kind of issues with email address. The issues with regular expression. So when I\'m validating with regular expressions. I was struck and still now I\'m not able to clear that one team anyone aware of this issue anyone have worked with regular expressions. Can anyone help me on this? Yes, can do I can help you with that. I have done that in last print itself. So it\'s quite fresh. Thank you, Keithy. Then I will start to work on the sign up below the fields. Please a clickable button sign up below the fields. That was that has been I need to finish. So I will work on that once after you are work. Can you please help me on that. Sure, sure, sure. I\'ll do that. Thank you so much, Keithy. You\'re very kind. So Shashank. That\'s it with the help of Keithy. Probably I will try to finish this by tomorrow at maximum. Yes, yes, we\'ll do it together. Yeah, thank you, Keithy. That\'s it on my end. Shashank. Thank you. That was an impediment I faced yesterday and still I\'m continuing tomorrow. Hopefully I will make it. All right. Thank you so much, everyone. Thank you, Keithy for jumping in there. All right. So that was really quick guys. Thank you so much for sharing your dates. And yes, so I\'m coming to the questions. So I hope you all I hope you are enjoying the way you are integrating these questions to the day. How are you planning everyday and are continuous. You know, our goal towards what to achieving a spring goal what we\'ve been doing. So yes, thank you so much guys. And I you guys really quickly adapted to the news and questions that we said and you\'re always ready for explain. So yeah, thanks for that guys. And yeah, coming to the action items for me. So with the pick I\'ll be working with the pick up every connected to central excellence for the dashboard, you know, vision of rules and also we\'d raise the change request. If needed to implement the same. And coming to T T she wants to help on connecting with the bad framework team who are doing the same mask, much better. So I\'ll be doing that and I\'ll be get back to you guys behind of the day. And so that we can quickly resolve them and we can move to the roadblocks. Yeah. Yeah, sure. Thank you. Awesome.

Any impediments that are raised in the Scrum meeting become the Scrum master\'s responsibility to ensure that are that they are resolved as quickly as possible. Typical impediments are for example I need help debugging a program or problem with an xyz or I\'m struggling to learn xyz and would like to pair with someone on it. Or it also can be I cannot get these ones so group give me any time and I need to meet with them or you can say some another example could be the departmental VP has asked me to work on something else for a day or two. You might have heard most of such scenarios with your teams as well. In such cases where the Scrum masters cannot remove these impediments directly by himself. Example usually the more technical issues when which we have a brief right now one of the examples he is still a responsibility for making sure someone on the team does quickly resolve the issue. Most teams conduct the daily Scrum meeting by having each person answer the three questions in order. You answer all three questions then the next person and the next and so on. An interesting alternative that some teams find helpful is to talk through one product backlog item before moving on to the next in this way and individual may get an update at multiple different times during the same meeting. Now let\'s take a look at the set of questions that we have all right so set a is nothing but the classic questions that we often keep using them. It could be different for a different sentence framework might wait right the questions might vary based on the framework of the question. What story did you work on yesterday who worked on it with you. And what story did you plan to tackle today what will you work with on it who will you work with on it. What obstacles if any do you anticipate finishing. So these set of classic questions are commonly used in all the teams both new and experienced teams. Now let us take a look at the new training set of questions that enable the teams to have a different perspective and think out of the box. The next set of questions is called as shared learning. In this set of questions can help teams which are in the forming stage which have begun the journey towards agile transformation. And it\'s can help teams to share their ways of learning, beat research or investigation. They\'re doing throughout the day to ensure the set of tax or commitments for the day are completed. This will help team members to share different ways of approach to one problem which can help other team members. The questions are in the work you did yesterday. What did you learn that could help the whole team. Who to learn today. How will you share it with all of us. What gets in your way of learning. And comes the next set of questions wherein you\'re trying to find some help. This set of questions can help new and experienced teams which are in forming or non-mixed stage. The questions allow team members to share their library of knowledge that their effort to in order to address any issues or challenges. These questions allows teams to explore and share knowledge or sources of knowledge and help each other. The questions are what helpful resources, example websites, books, articles, repositories, team members, expertise, etc. And you can share your work wherever you look for help today. When have you found it difficult to find helpful resources. What gets in the way. The next set of questions are said, D that is achieving the plan. In this set of questions can help both the can help the experienced teams strategize to achieve the plan. No sprint goal can be achieved by a single person in the team. It is a collaborative effort of the whole team. With these questions, it reminds all the team members. All the team players to know how important their role is to achieve the plan. By using the conference index towards the end of the questions on a scale of 0 to 5. We come up. We come to know the pulse of the team, which boosts their morale and confidence sprint, confidence level sprint after sprint. Let\'s take a look at the questions. How did you help the team move towards achieving our iteration plan yesterday. How will you help us move forward in the plan today. What will impede your progress. How will you help us move forward in the plan. On a scale of 0 to 5. Zero being no way and 5 being super confident. How confident are you that we will complete all the work in our iteration plan. Coming to the last but not the least set of questions. What are the questions. What are the questions. What did you commit yesterday. What do you hope to commit today. What hinders your ability to continuously integrate your work today. Those were some interesting questions. I hope these are something different, which you can help your teams to come up with different ideas and thoughts during your daily scrum meeting. I would also like to share a couple of basic rules or maybe you can say just during the meetings, which I share with my teams. So some news and don\'ts in a meeting, which can really be helpful for your meetings to be more effective and more informative. So the do\'s are please turn on your camera for all the meetings. So I request all my team members to turn on the cameras. Why the camera should be turned on. So as we are all a connected virtually. The two most important factors that we need to utilize to the fullest to ensure maximum exchange of information via communication is audio and video in any virtual meeting. This will help the facilitator, the scrum master to know if you\'re able to keep up with the discussion or you want us to slow down. And the another important point is that this will also help the facilitator know that if you that you are participating in the meeting 100% as we might need your thoughts and inputs during any point of the meeting. And the most next important point is ensure internet connection is stable and bandwidth is good enough to support video calls. And the don\'ts are please do not multitask during any meeting. Team might get met need your 100% attention to provide suggestions and valuable inputs during the meeting. Don\'t be late to meetings always join the meeting on time to have a productive and time box meetings to our extension that might impact the following meetings. So these do\'s and don\'ts are for any meeting regardless of any event throughout your day. Right. So I think these are some basic instructions that we can share with our teams. So I just thought to share with you all. All right. I think that was it for today. Hey, thanks ashan for the presentation. Over to you, Shashank. You can start the demo now. Thank you. So let me quickly start sharing my screen and begin my thought in this country. All right. I hope you are all able to see my screen. Yes. Awesome. So yes, guys. So let me be doing our daily strom everyday using some classic questions, right? The regular questions that we have. What you work on yesterday, what story you plan for today and what impermeasantly. Right. So just to blame that, monotonous questions. So we have come up with some new set of questions like we just introduced on day one of us. Today, we are. So let us go ahead with this set of questions that is said to be where Neha will be sharing her plan for the day. Yeah. Over to you, Neha. Yeah. Hi, Shashank. Good morning.

So basically this will help our team towards to achieve our initial step towards our print pool. So today I will be working on database creation of login page. So here after today\'s task, I will hoping to learn to write the optimized way or good way of query basically. So in the average task that I do, basically I will definitely I learn definitely I learned something. So when I will complete my all the task, I\'m I\'m hoping or I will be in a part to learn about a database like how to increase the memory of database or how to write a good query. That is all from my intuition. Nice. Thanks. Thanks. Okay. All right. Now let\'s move on to the next set of questions and a set C finding help. So the become what you like to share your updates on your story with respect to these persons. Sure, Shashank. So I\'m working with respect to SS 11 user story.

So as for the sprint goal, we are targeting to implement the login page for the portal itself in this sprint. So for that, my story was related to the masking of the login page password. I tried yesterday building on a framework which can easily enable the functionality, but currently I am facing. So my plan was to move ahead forward today, but yesterday I had connected with some teams who have already worked on it, but somehow is that is not working, maybe the graph capacity or they don\'t have time for help. So Sheshankar would need your help in this to help me solve this impediment and on a scale of zero to five. I am currently not very confident because we are on the fifth day of the sprint. So we would be maybe on a scale of five I\'m at to currently if we get little help, I\'m sure we\'ll be able to do the story. Sure, definitely, we can the problem and we get to speak with those team members and get all the help you need to make it. Thank you. Thank you. And Manoj, would you like to share your updates? Yes, sure, Shankar. So my name is SS 14. As we committed the implementation for login functionality, right. So the backend part is already completed implementation of the services and the UI part was taken care by Deepika that also completed, but the challenging part here was the backend, the production data, which we are expecting from the client set to validate the same from the development perspective. So I hope we are getting this today. So that there are no impediments at this moment. We have completed all the development part. Only thing is waiting for the testing from development and if we have completing, then we are good. So part of like confident level from zero to five, I could say like we are sure we\'ll complete my today. That\'s great. Thanks, Manoj. Thanks for the word of confidence there.
